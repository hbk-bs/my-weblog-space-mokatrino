        <h2>About me :)</h2>

        <p>Hi, my name is Katya. I am 20 years old, born and raised in Ukraine, at least until I was 18 y.o. Technically, I'm mentally stuck somewhere until February 24, 2022. Crying, sobbing, throwing up.
            
             <p>Then I would not have believed what is happening to me now, but it is happening, and now I am doing homework for the German University of Arts. 
                Some fun facts about me: I am a picky eater, hate occupants and love spring. </p>


            In this mini blog, that hopefully I will manage to make, I will post some updates about my new gained knowledge in the field of design. 
        </p>
